# Core Erlang Mini

This project aims to investigate possible formalisations of program equivalence (behavioural, contextual, CIU equivalence and logical relations) using a small subset of Core Erlang, including lists, pattern matching and recursion.

# Requirements

This project only depends on Coq, version 8.13.2 or later.

# Installation

`make` compiles the library
